DISCLAIMER ON AI-ASSISTED CODE GENERATION

Parts of the source code in this repository may have been written or refactored with the assistance of large language models (LLMs), specifically OpenAI’s GPT models (ChatGPT). These tools were employed to accelerate development, explore alternative implementations, and resolve programming issues.

While the generated code was always reviewed, tested, and adapted by the author to fit the project requirements, it is important to note that the use of AI systems may introduce risks such as:

non-optimal or verbose code structures,

hidden security vulnerabilities,

unintentional similarity with publicly available code snippets.

The final responsibility for the correctness, functionality, and scientific integrity of the code remains with the author.
